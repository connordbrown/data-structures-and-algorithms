# "Your plans always cost too much!" Mr E exclaimed. He never told you he was on a budget,
# nor how much each fertilizer cost, but somehow he expected you to factor in his fixed income
# while growing his increasingly ornate jungle frog habitats. You delicately ask how much each
# fertilizer costs, and got the following information:  

# Daily growth (in)	Cost ($)
#            1	    1
#            4	    2
#            5	    3
#           11	    7

# Given n, and initial investment ùê∑0, plan how Mr E can grow an n inch bean stalk while avoiding the 'dead lengths' (when the stalk grows to a length 2 mod 7), and not going over budget.

# 3A: Write a recurrence - write a recurrence minDropsWithBudget(j, D, n) given a stalk of length j, with budget D, 
# that returns the minimum number of drops of fertilizer needed to grow to length n, while avoiding any intermediate length k where k = 2 mod 7.
