# "Your plans always cost too much!" Mr E exclaimed. He never told you he was on a budget,
# nor how much each fertilizer cost, but somehow he expected you to factor in his fixed income
# while growing his increasingly ornate jungle frog habitats. You delicately ask how much each
# fertilizer costs, and got the following information:  

# Daily growth (in)	Cost ($)
#            1	    1
#            4	    2
#            5	    3
#           11	    7
