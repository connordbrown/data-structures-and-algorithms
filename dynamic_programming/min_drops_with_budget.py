# "Your plans always cost too much!" Mr E exclaimed. He never told you he was on a budget,
# nor how much each fertilizer cost, but somehow he expected you to factor in his fixed income
# while growing his increasingly ornate jungle frog habitats. You delicately ask how much each
# fertilizer costs, and got the following information:  

# Daily growth (in)	Cost ($)
#            1	    1
#            4	    2
#            5	    3
#           11	    7

# Given n, and initial investment ùê∑0, plan how Mr E can grow an n inch bean stalk while avoiding the 'dead lengths' (when the stalk grows to a length 2 mod 7), and not going over budget.

# 3A: Write a recurrence - write a recurrence minDropsWithBudget(j, D, n) given a stalk of length j, with budget D, 
# that returns the minimum number of drops of fertilizer needed to grow to length n, while avoiding any intermediate length k where k = 2 mod 7.
def minDropsWithBudget(j, D, n):
    # base case: initial length of stalk
    if (n == j):
        return 0
    
    # base case: invalid stalk length
    if (n < j):
        return float('inf')
    
    # possible growth lengths and corresponding costs
    drops = [(1, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (11, 7)]
    
    # start with worst possible min_drops
    min_drops = float('inf')
    
    # iterate through different drops and their corresponding costs
    for drop, cost in drops:
        # get new_length and new_budget based on drop size
        new_length = n - drop
        new_budget = D - cost
        
        # check if new length is not 'dead length' and cost is within budget - could also check for negative length to speed up calculation
        if new_length % 7 != 2 and new_budget > 0:
            # add 1 for each drop used 
            num_drops = 1 + minDropsWithBudget(j, new_budget, new_length)
            # get minimum number of drops
