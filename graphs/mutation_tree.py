# You're given a list of bacteria RNA fragments, all from related bacteria which have mutated into separate strains over time. 
# Your goal is to come up with the most likely sequence of mutations that led to this state of affairs.

# The chance that one bacteria mutated into another depends on the number of differences in their RNA strings. The more differences
# in their RNA strings, the more unlikely it is that the bacteria mutated into each other.
# (In fact, exponentially more unlikely -- the probability that k locations changed at the same time is  2‚àíùëò ).

# If we construct a fully connected graph whose nodes represent RNA fragments and each edge has weight 2‚àíùëò , where k is the number of differences between RNA strings,
# then a spanning tree which maximizes the product of edge weights will be the most likely mutation tree.
# (Each mututation is assumed to be independent, so the chance that all the mutations in the spanning tree happen is the product of their respective probabilities)

# Write a function that takes a list of RNA fragments, constructs an edge list with weights, then returns the most likely mutation tree, along with its probability.

# Note: your algorithm should construct a graph and then run your implementation of Kruskal's algorithm on it. 
# The difficulty lies in determining the correct graph, so that a minimum sum spanning tree in your graph corresponds to a maximum product spanning tree in the graph described above.

# Input: ["adad","adac","acad", "cdac","addd"]
# Output: ([('adad', 'adac', 0.5), ('adad', 'acad', 0.5), ('adad', 'addd', 0.5), ('adac', 'cdac', 0.5)], 0.0625)
